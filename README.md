# Intelligent Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks

**Project Overview:**
This GitHub repository houses the code and resources for an intelligent scheduling strategy developed to optimize sensor energy consumption and enhance system state estimation within a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning, particularly the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm, to tackle the challenges of scheduling in WSNs.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Reinforcement Learning:** This project leverages Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning paradigm, to enable the sensor network to learn and adapt its scheduling strategy over time.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** DQN is a specialized algorithm within Reinforcement Learning used to approximate the optimal action-value function for decision-making.
- **Q-Learning:** Q-Learning is a fundamental concept in Reinforcement Learning and serves as a basis for understanding DQN.
- **Machine Learning:** The project incorporates machine learning principles to enhance scheduling decisions.
- **Gymnasium and Stable Baselines3:** These technologies are employed to create a customized environment for simulating and training the intelligent scheduling strategy.

**Environment Description:**
The core of this project is a customized gym environment, 'WSNEnvironment,' specifically designed to represent the WSN scenario. Here are some key features of this environment:
- **Sensor Deployment:** The environment allows for the creation of a customizable sensor network with a defined number of sensors.
- **Coverage and Energy Optimization:** It simulates the process of optimizing sensor energy usage while ensuring efficient coverage of the monitored area.
- **Event Handling:** The environment models the generation and detection of events within the sensor network, mimicking real-world scenarios.

**How to Use:**
